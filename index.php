<h1>PHP OOP Interface</h1>
<p>Interface are used to inherite more than one classes (properties and methods) in a class. </p>
<p>Interface exactly works like Abstract Class. So we can not make its own Object.</p>
<p>we can not either make properties or variables in interface and can not assign them value.</p>
<p>In interface we can declare methods but we can not implement them. we use them for drived class.</p>
